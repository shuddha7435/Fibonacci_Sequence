# Fibonacci_Sequence

Here I have written the Fibonacci Sequence program in golang. Full code is here in the repository. 
I have used comments to explain the code.

I have displayed the first 30 Fibonacci numbers.

I used Goland IDE to write the code.

Here I have attached the output from GoLand IDE.
